# Toy-Problems
## Algorithm challenges for fun

These algorithms were sourced from various websites online that provide a range of algorithm challenges
that can be solved using any programming language of choice. The ones in this repo were all solved
to their completeness in JavaScript. Each toy problem contains an explanation of the algorithm's
input and expected result, following a functional procedure that I've written to satisfy the 
variable requirements of producing the result. 

Some of the websites that reference to these algorithms are:


www.coderbyte.com (They have since switched to a subscription model)

www.projecteuler.net/archives (A math playground for programmers)

www.w3schools.com (The JS challenges page)
